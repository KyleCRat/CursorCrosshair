# Changelog

All notable changes to Crosshair Cursor will be documented in this file.

## [12.0.1-4] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- Elvui Scale not triggering line size change function
- Lines are now locked to screen width and screen height instead of doing the silly thing of locking both x and y centers to cursor and making them 2x screen size. Horizontal line just moves up and down vertical line just moves right to left. 

### Changed
- Update version

## [12.0.1-3] - 2026-02-03

### Changed
- Update version
- Setup automatic releases
